 5. Write a function named assignGrade that: takes 1 argument, a number score. returns a grade for the score, either "A", "B", "C", "D", or “F". Call that function for a few different scores and log the result to make sure it works.
 6. Write a function named pluralize that: takes 2 arguments, a noun and a number. returns the number and pluralized form, like "5 cats" or "1 dog”. Call that function for a few different scores and log the result to make sure it works. Bonus: Make it handle a few collective nouns like "sheep" and “geese".
